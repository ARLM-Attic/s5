# LICENSES #

## Original S5 Code in Public Domain ##

S5 v1.1 and later have been explicitly placed into the Public Domain by
the original author, Eric A. Meyer. The following excerpt from the [S5
FAQ](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/faq.html) spells out the details:

> **What are the licensing terms, and how do they affect the content of
> a slide show done in S5?**
>
> First, whatever license S5 has or did have, it will only ever apply to
> the technology, not the content. You can prepare a confidential
> presentation where the content is not only copyrighted and patented,
> but Top Secret as well. S5's license will not affect it.
>
> As of version 1.1, the technology itself has been explicitly released
> into the Public Domain, so there are no restrictions whatsoever on its
> use or reuse (nor can there ever be). S5 v1.0 was published under a
> Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license, which still holds
> for that version of the software. The change was made because I found
> out CC licenses aren't appropriate for software only after 1.0 came
> out. Oops.

## Contributing to a Public Domain project ##

As a programmer, and not a copyright lawyer, this is merely an informed
opinion. Please keep that in mind.

Under current copyright law, most code is considered to have copyright
unless an explicit grant is made to the Public Domain. This makes a
shared Public Domain project difficult, because it means that every
contribution must contain a similar grant, as well as an implied
warranty that the contributor owns the code (no borrowing from other
projects, even open-source ones!) and has the legal right to donate the
code into the Public Domain.

This creates a tracking problem for derivative works, especially where
small patches and incremental improvements are concerned. A grant to the
Public Domain can never be revoked, but there may be a loophole that
will allow the community to grow without administrative headaches.

## Derivative Works Under GNU General Public License ##

Creative changes to a public domain work may be entitled to copyright
protection. Therefore, in order to grow the community around the S5
codebase and encourage sharing, this project is adopting the GPL _for
code which is not part of the original public domain grant_. This
project in no way asserts any copyright over the original work of Eric
A. Meyer or other contributors to the original work placed into the
Public Domain, but reserves the right to license derivative works under
an alternative license.

Therefore, the portions of this program which are _not_ part of the
explicit public domain grant are licensed under the GPL, which should be
construed to apply only to the portions of the code that may be
considered a derivative work. For those portions, the following license
applies:

> **Copyright 2010 Todd A. Jacobs, et al.**
>
> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
> it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
> the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
> your option) any later version.
>
> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
> WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
> General Public License for more details.
>
> You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
> along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The idea is that patches, bug fixes, new features, and incremental
improvements can be added to the project without having to make (or
track) an explicit grant of any kind; authorial attribution by the
submitter is all that should be required, and such tracking of
committers is baked into the Git revision control system.
